# Who is using this service?

Existing famous link shortener services, such as `bitly`, `tinyurl`, etc.,
offer similar features but requires an unreasonably overpriced subscription fee.
Therefore, the initial purpose of building this service is to support link
shortener under domain [changkun.de](https://changkun.de), and
it is one of the active user of this service currently.

I wrote `redir` under [golang.design/s/redir](https://golang.design/s/redir)
initially. Due to the different requirements, this project has branched out
from it and has a different architecture and feature set now.

The current known users:

- changkun.de
- golang.design
